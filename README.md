# CS_Racket
All source code for your demo application should be well documented at the class or library level, as well as at the method level, and inline in code where appropriate. Your git repository must include a README.txt or README.md file that fully explains the project, all dependencies, and the actual application. You must also maintain author and contributors in each class header or library header, as well as a revision date and version number. Try to make sure that there is some correspondence between version numbers and git commit comments.

v1.02
We will be exploring the uses of DrRacket. There will be some examples and working versions of the code to show the working language.



Eric Zheng and Akhil Giridhar:
  Checkers Game
    Define function, create conditionals, have base-cases, and result
Akhil Giridhar:
  Fibonacci Sequence
    Define function, create conditionals, have base-cases, and result
Arvind Kumar:
  Factorial Code
    Define function, create conditionals, have base-cases, and result
Anish Kolan
  Length Code with Java Version
    Define function, create conditionals, having recursion, having the Java version
    
    We chose to work on 4 DrRacket programs. One of the programs was a comparison program that compared Java and DrRacket in accomplishing similar tasks. It consisted of tracking the length of a list in DrRacket without using the length function and finding the length of an ArrayList in Java without using the length function in Java. Then, our group wrote programs that would output the nth term of the fibonacci sequence or the nth factorial. The checkers game was a very long program and required complete team effort, but the foremost contributors were Eric Zheng and Akhil Giridhar. The program was essentially a cartesian plane and kept track of a list of coordinates and removed them as actions were performed. However, the addition of images and color made the game appear to be much more than that. All of the programs for this project used recursion.
