# CS_Racket
All source code for your demo application should be well documented at the class or library level, as well as at the method level, and inline in code where appropriate. Your git repository must include a README.txt or README.md file that fully explains the project, all dependencies, and the actual application. You must also maintain author and contributors in each class header or library header, as well as a revision date and version number. Try to make sure that there is some correspondence between version numbers and git commit comments.
